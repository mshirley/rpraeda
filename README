Ruby implementation of Praeda

http://www.foofus.net/?page_id=218

modify rpraeda.rb and set server to the target host, port, etc...

https isn't supported right now so don't bother changing scheme

this script requires rubygems and yaml gem

sudo apt-get install rubygems
sudo gem instal yaml

ruby rpraeda.rb
