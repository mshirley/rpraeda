this is the praeda metasploit module.

you can either copy mpraeda.rb to msf3/modules/auxiliary/scanner/http or create a similar directory in ~/.msf3/modules/auxiliary/scanner/http and copy it there.

this script also uses some config files that it loads at start.

copy *.yaml to msf3/data or specify locations with YAML_INV_CONFIG and YAML_JOB_CONFIG

start msfconsole

msf > use auxiliary/scanner/http/mpraeda
msf auxiliary(mpraeda) > set RHOSTS localhost
RHOSTS => localhost
msf auxiliary(mpraeda) > run
